## Pre-Implementation Blockers

| # | Blocker | Status | Resolution |
|---|---------|--------|------------|
| BLOCK-1 | intel_sources schema verification (OQ-07) | RESOLVED | Schema verified from TarvaRI migration files. `id` column EXISTS (UUID PK). Full schema: 29 columns (base 27 + migration 012 adds `last_poll_at`, `last_ingestion_at`). SOW's `IntelSourceRow` needs `id: string` added — will do during WS-1.3. |
| BLOCK-2 | CategoryMeta.description field | RESOLVED | Already specified in WS-1.2 SOW line 101: `description: string`. All 15 entries in `KNOWN_CATEGORIES` include descriptions. No action needed. |
